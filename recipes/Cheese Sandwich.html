    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut apple, beetroot, and carrot into big pieces.</li>
      <li>
        Place 1 chopped apple, 1/2 chopped beetroot, and 1 large chopped carrot
        in the big jar of a blender or a mixer grinder. Add 1 tablespoon lemon
        juice (juice from 1/2 small lime or lemon), 1 inch piece chopped ginger,
        and 1/2 cup water.
      </li>
      <li>Blend until smooth.</li>
      <li>
        Take a large bowl and keep a fine metal strainer over it. Spread a
        cheesecloth over it and pour the prepared mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gather the cloth from all the sides towards the center and twist and
        press it to squeeze out the juice. You can strain the juice using a nut
        milk bag as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discard the fibrous pulp. You can use this pulp to make paratha dough or
        add to soup as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the juice into serving glasses and serve immediately to get the
        maximum benefits. You can store this juice in the refrigerator for 1-2
        days.
